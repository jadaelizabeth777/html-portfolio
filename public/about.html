<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, My name is Jada Bostic. I am a emerging web developer with a passion for technology! I was introduced to the tech world at a young age, which was watching my uncle Andrew play on his PC and build websites as well. I looked up to all of his work, he was in photography which was a plus! My uncle would take these beautiful pictures and incorperate them in his own websites. </p>

<p>Fast foward about a decade and here I am! I have faced alot of adversity but despite that I perservere through it all. My goal is to become a successful web developer and make an impact in the tech industry. Hopefully one day I will be able to help others who are just starting out in the tech world like I was. I would like to start up a non-profit to introduce younger generations to the exciting possibilities of technology.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read a little about me. If you would like to get in contact with me please visit the contact me page! </p>
